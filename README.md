## 🚀 About Me

I build intuitive frontend platforms and scalable backend systems powering enterprise SaaS subscription management at Cisco. My work supports high-revenue software products and focuses on reliability, security, and performance at scale.

As a MIDS Fellow at UC Berkeley, I’m expanding into machine learning, generative AI, and applied analytics to bridge large-scale engineering with intelligent systems.
